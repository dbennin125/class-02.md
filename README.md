# Text

structural markup: elements describe header AND paragraph.
semantic markup: provides additional information in sentence (example
a quote from someone)

 headers-can have muliple headers (up to 6) < h1>< h2>< h3>..etc.

< p> generally more than one sentence just like a newspaper.

**bold** quite obvious what this does. 

*italic* again this one is obvious.

sup -tricky but when numbers need to special and above "superior" the letter called super script or above the word

sub-the oposite of sup it's beneath the word
<br >

< br> breaks up text into a new line 

< hr> creates a horizontal demarcated line in the text < strong>tells the compute to make the word pop 

< em> unlike strong just a subtle change similar to italics< 

< blockquote> take a block of text and make it quotes usually takes up a paragraph. you will still use p tags. 

< q> --short quotes 

< abbr> aka abbreviation < s> = strikeout < ins>text being inserted in 

< del>text being deleted
## CSS

Box element--< h1>, < p>, < div>.
Inline element--< b>, < img>, < span>

Boxes-(what can be done) width, height, borders, background color or image, position in browser

Text-typeface, size, color, italics, bolds uppercase, lowercase,small cap

To have CSS work you need a selector and a decleration (a decleration will have a property and a value (example color:red)).

How to use: you will need a < link> (which includes <  href>, < type>, or < rel>) to CSS from HTML
    Style-give attributes which you gives values in CSS.

Selectors 
    examples: *{}-universal selector , type selector (h1,h2 etc). class selector- .selector {}, p.note{}.
    id selector- #idName {},

Last rule: what ever was last will be can add !important to help guide computer. 

inheritance- child elements will inherit what CSS tells them.

### Basic Javascript
Statements- individual instruction or code will end with a semi-colon.
Comments-this is what the code will do
Variables-temp place holder for information
    ex var NAME but written var name:
    you can assign variables vaule
        example name = 3;.
Data types
numeric-numbers
string-text
boolean - true false statements
        can use shorthand to write
Array-information stored in subset of box

expressions- results into a single vaule. ex var color ='blue';
operators- allow results from more values
    +,-,*,/,++,--, %
#### decision making
 two components to a decision: evaluate condition and contional statement (pass/fail)
    comparison operators ==(equal to)!=(not equal to), ===(strictly equal),!===(strictly not equal to), > greater than, < less than, <= Less than equal to >= greater than equal to
